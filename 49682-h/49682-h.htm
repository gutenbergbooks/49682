    <h2>
      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following trifles have already made their appearance in various
      periodicals. The limit of their pretension is obvious from their
      individual brevity and collective title; with few exceptions, they were
      intended simply as drawing-room songs. Without aspiring to the high level
      of the days when Praed, Bayly, Hood, Fitzgerald, Theodore Hook, and the
      two Smiths wrote for music, may I flatter myself that these Carols are at
      least equal in point of taste (if not in point of humour) to certain light
      and lively ballads that are at present popular through the medium of the
      music-halls?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some readers will probably think the name of this book suspiciously
      similar to that of Mr Frederick Locker's charming <i>London Lyrics</i>.
      Let me anticipate a charge of plagiarism by observing that Mr. Locker
      himself was kind enough to send me the suggestion for my present title.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those gentlemen who have given me permission to republish various
      verses in this collection, I am sincerely obliged.

      I'VE a genius or a talent&mdash;I perceive it pretty clearly

    <p class="indent20">
      In pursuing an ambition or in climbing up a tree&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For never quite attaining, but attaining very nearly
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To my aspiration's altitude, whatever it may be.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Tis a faculty that haunts me with an obstinate persistence,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For I felt it in my boyhood, and I feel it in my prime,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      All the efforts and endeavours I have made in my existence
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Have invariably ended "but a step from the sublime."

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As a boy I made a tender of my tenderest affection,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      In a lovely little sonnet to the fairest of the fair:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      (Though nothing but a youngster, I've preserved the recollection
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Of her tyranny, her beauty, and the way she did her hair.)
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She was married, I remember, to a person in the City,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I consider'd him remarkably obtrusive at the time;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So I quitted my enslaver with a lofty look of pity,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For I felt my situation "but a step from the sublime."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Being confident that Cupid was a little gay deceiver,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      I forgot my disappointment in a struggle after Fame;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I had caught the rage of writing as a child may catch a fever,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      So I took to making verses as a way to make a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When I publish'd a collection of my efforts as a writer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a minimum of reason and a maximum of rhyme&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I am proud to say that nobody could well have been politer
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Than the critics, for they, call'd it "but a step from the
    </p>

      sublime."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I was laudably ambitious to extend my reputation,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And I plann'd a pretty novel on a pretty novel plan;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I would make it independent both of sin and of "sensation,"
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And my villain should be pictured as a persecuted man.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For your Bulwers and your Braddons and your Collinses
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      may grovel

    <p class="indent20">
      In an atmosphere of horror and a wilderness of crime;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Twas for me to controvert them, and I did so in a novel
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Which was commonly consider'd "but a step from the
    </p>

      sublime."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I have master'd metaphysics&mdash;I have mounted on the pinions
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Both of Painting and of Music&mdash;and I rather think I know
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ev'ry nook and ev'ry corner of Apollo's whole dominions,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      From the top of Mount Parnassus down to Paternoster Row.

    <p class="indent15">
      I have had my little failures, I have had my great successes&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And Parnassus, I assure you, is a weary hill to climb;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But the lowest and the meanest of my enemies confesses

      That he very often thinks me "but a step from the sublime."

      In fact, if you ever learnt Greek, you 'll confess

      That it's hardly the right kind of tongue to impress

    <p class="indent15">
      An intelligent lobster or well-inform'd crab,

    <p class="indent15">
      With the deepest respect for the Gift of the Gab.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Still Eloquence gives men a wonderful power,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And it often strikes me, after sitting an hour
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At a lecture on something I don't understand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the Gift of the Gab is decidedly grand.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Indeed, I am frequently heard to declare,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      If the Queen of the Fairies would answer my prayer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I should instantly drop on my knees to Queen Mab,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Crying, Grant me, oh grant me, the Gift of the Gab.

    <p>

    <p class="indent15">
      If you 'd hear the true summit of Eloquence reach'd
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Go to church when a charity-sermon is preach'd;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Where, with hands in his pockets and tears in his eyes,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ev'ry soft-hearted sinner contributes and cries.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I think, if you look in the plate, you'll opine
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the sermon you heard was uncommonly fine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And that ev'ry Oxonian and ev'ry Cantab
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ought to cultivate early the Gift of the Gab.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But it's after a dinner at Freemasons' Hall
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the orator's talent shines brightest of all;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When his eye becomes glazed and his voice becomes thick,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he's had so much hock he can only say hie!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So the company leave him to slumber and snore
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till he's put in a hat and convey'd to the door;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he finds, upon reaching his home in a cab,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That his wife rather shines in the Gift of the Gab.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then there's Gab in the senate and Gab at the bar,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But I fear their description would lead me too far;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And (last but not least) there is Gab on the stage.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Which I couldn't exhaust if I sang for an age.

    <p class="indent15">
      But, if there are matters that puzzle you still,

    <p class="indent15">
      You may take up an Enfield and go through a drill,

    <p class="indent15">
      Which will teach you much more than a hurried confab

    <p class="indent15">
      With regard to that art call'd the Gift of the Gab.

      LONG, long ago I had an aunt

    <p class="indent30">
      Who took me to the play:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An act of kindness that I shan't

      Forget for many a day.

    <p class="indent20">
      I was a youngster at the time,

      And fancied that it must be "prime"

    <p>
      <br />

    <p class="indent20">
      I ventured to express the same
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      In quite a candid way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And shock'd my aunt&mdash;a sober dame,

      Had finished planning Duncan's death,

      I recollect that evening yet,

      The lecture I received.

      listen, little children, to a proper
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      little song
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Of a naughty little urchin who was
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      always doing wrong:
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      He disobey'd his mammy, and he
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      disobey'd his dad,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And he disobey'd his uncle, which
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      was very near as bad.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He wouldn't learn to cypher, and he wouldn't learn to write,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But he would tear up his copy-books to fabricate a kite;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he used his slate and pencil in so barbarous a way,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That the grinders of his governess got looser ev'ry day.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At last he grew so obstinate that no one could contrive
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To cure him of a theory that two and two made five;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And, when they taught him how to spell, he show'd his wicked
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      whims
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      By mutilating Pinnock and mislaying Watts's Hymns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Instead of all such pretty books, (which <i>must</i> improve the mind,)
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He cultivated volumes of a most improper kind;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Directories and almanacks he studied on the sly,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And gloated over Bradshaw's Guide when nobody was by.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From such a course of reading you can easily divine
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The condition of his morals at the age of eight or nine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His tone of conversation kept becoming worse and worse,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Till it scandalis'd his governess and horrified his nurse.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He quoted bits of Bradshaw that were quite unfit to hear,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And recited from the Almanack, no matter who was near:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He talked of Reigate Junction and of trains both up and down,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And referr'd to men who call'd themselves Jones, Robinson, and
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But when this naughty boy grew up he found the proverb true,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That Fate one day makes people pay for all the wrong they do.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He was cheated out of money by a man whose name was Brown,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And got crippled in a railway smash while coming up to town.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So, little boys and little girls, take warning while you can,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And profit by the history of this unhappy man.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Read Dr Watts and Pinnock, dears; and when you learn to spell,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Shun Railway Guides, Directories, and Almanacks as well!

      That lightly draws its breath,

      "I've got a pain inside!

      Last night about eleven

      Said I, "What is it makes you bad?

    <p class="indent20">
      How many apples have you had?''

      She answer'd, "Only seven!"

      "And are you sure you took no more,

    <p class="indent20">
      I wonder'd hugely what she meant,

    <p class="indent30">
      And said, "I'm bad at riddles,

    <p class="indent20">
      But I know where little girls are sent

    <p class="indent20">
      Of seeing poor Brown, I was forcibly struck

    <p class="indent15">
      By his alter'd appearance, and thought, What, a pity

    <p class="indent20">
      To see the old fellow so down on his luck.

    <p class="indent15">
      From the crown of a hat that was horribly seedy

      There were holes in his gloves&mdash;his umbrella was cotton&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      His coat was a faded invisible green;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And in prominent bulbs, through the trowsers he'd got on,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The marks of his knees, or <i>patellae</i>, were seen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But it seem'd above all inexpressibly painful
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To notice the efforts he made to conceal&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      By a tone partly nervous and partly disdainful&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The fact of his looking so shabby-genteel.

    <p>

    <p class="indent15">
      "How is business?" I ask'd him;&mdash;"and what are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To tell you the truth I decidedly had
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A belief that the trade he had last been pursuing
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      (Whatever its nature) had gone to the bad..
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      His reply was a sigh:&mdash;it was little good urging
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      The questions afresh, for I could not but feel
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That he saw not a prospect of ever emerging
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Above the dead-level of shabby-genteel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When we parted I sunk into gloomy reflection&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A state of the mind that I hate, by the way&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I gave my Brown-studies a moral direction&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Though, put into poetry, morals don't pay.

    <h3>
      NO. 1. COD LIVER OIL.
    </h3>
    <p class="indent15">
      ON the bleak shore of Norway, I 've lately been told,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Large numbers of cod-fish are found,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the animals' livers are afterwards sold
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      At so many "pfennigs" per pound;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From which is extracted, with infinite toil,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A villainous fluid called cod-liver oil!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Now, I don't mind a powder, a pill, or a draught&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Though I mingle the former with jam&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And many's the mixture I've cheerfully quaff'd,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And the pill I have gulp'd like a lamb.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But then I envelop my pills in tin-foil,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I can't do the same with my cod-liver oil!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the course of my lifetime I 've swallow'd enough
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To have floated a ship of the line,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And it 's purely the fault of this horrible stuff
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      That I've ceased to enjoy ginger wine.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For how can you wonder to see me recoil
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From a liquor I mix'd with my cod-liver oil?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There are few deeds of daring from which I should quail&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      There are few things I'd tremble to do&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But there's one kind of tonic that makes me turn pale,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And quite spoils my appetite, too;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But, you see, just at present, I Ve got none to spoil&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So I don't mind alluding to cod-liver oil!

      NO. 2. NIGHT AND MORNING.

      They brought to my couch (I had not slept a wink,

      Saying, "Please to take two of the pills every night

    <p>

      After slowly perusing these words once or twice,

    <p class="indent20">
      In a deeply contemplative way,

    <p class="indent15">
      I exclaim'd, what a volume of useful advice

    <p class="indent20">
      Does this one little sentence convey!

      My friends, though to-day may seem cloudless and bright,

    <p class="indent20">
      Neglect not to-morrow's dark warning;

      And oh! while you 're taking the pills of to-night,

      A DARK German legend survives to this
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Which relates to a Gottingen student,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who came by his talent for music, they say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      At a much higher price than was prudent.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I'd rather not mention the bargain he made,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But his playing was reckon'd so clever
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As even to put Doctor Liszt in the shade,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And extinguish Herr Thalberg for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      My hero was anxious his rivals should see
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      How completely he beat them all hollow;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he sent round his cards for aesthetics and tea,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With some meerschaums and music to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Then round his respected mahogany met
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      All the wisdom of Gottingen city;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And History mentions that one of the set
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      <i>(Not</i> a German) was decently witty.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of course the disputing and noise was immense,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As is always the case with deep thinkers;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But I hear that the tea showed its excellent sense,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      By agreeing with most of its drinkers.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then the music began, and the guests open'd fire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With fugues, and sonatas, and such-like;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Which are things that we Englishmen don't much admire,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Though they 're just what the Germans and Dutch like.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Our hero stepp'd forth, and his countenance shone
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With that mixture of stern resolution
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And graceful reserve that a martyr puts on,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      When he walks to his own execution.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He turn'd back his cuffs and he put back his hair,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And, after these grave preparations,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sat down and perform'd an original air,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a dozen superb variations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When he fancied his audience was growing more warm,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And the interest rapidly heightening,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He treated the room to an improvised storm,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With abundance of thunder and lightning.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It seemed as if peal after peal rent the sky,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a rumbling sepulchral and hollow;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And fierce lurid flashes pour'd forth from on high,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a speed that no mortal could follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of course such a state of affairs could not last,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And the player at length made his mind up,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      By a whirlwind of octaves play'd furious and fast,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To bring the display to a wind-up.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He finish'd his piece and look'd modestly round,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Expecting loud cheers and encoring;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Imagine his utter disgust when he found
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Every soul in the company snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He summon'd his tempter in fury, they say,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And accused him of treacherous dealings,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In selling him powers that were quite thrown away,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Amongst wretches who hadn't got feelings.

      "Well, I own," said the Fiend, "they are not well-behaved.

      "It's a British drama wholly, written quite in days of yore.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Tis an Andalusian story of a castle old and hoary,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the music is delicious, though the dialogue be poor!"
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      (And I could not help agreeing that the dialogue was poor:
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Very flat, and nothing more.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But at last a lady entered, and my interest grew center'd
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In her figure, and her features, and the costume that she wore.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the slightest sound she utter'd was like music; so I mutter'd
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To my neighbour, "Glance a minute at your play-bill, I implore.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who's that rare and radiant maiden? Tell, oh, tell me! I implore.'
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Quoth my neighbour, "Nelly Moore!"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Then I ask'd in quite a tremble&mdash;it was useless to dissemble&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      "Miss, or Madam, do not trifle with my feelings any more;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Tell me who, then, was the maiden, that appear'd so sorrow laden
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      In the room of David Garrick, with a bust above the door?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      (With a bust of Julius CÃ¦sar up above the study door.)
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Quoth my neighbour, "Nelly Moore."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I've her photograph from Lacy's; that delicious little face is
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Smiling on me as I'm sitting (in a draught from yonder door),
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And often in the nightfalls, when a precious little light falls
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      From the wretched tallow candles on my gloomy second-floor.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      (For I have not got the gaslight on my gloomy second-floor,)
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Comes an echo, "Nelly Moore!"

      I am sorry that the critics have

      been down upon ye lately.

      best regards,

    <p class="indent15">
      And to tell ye that I count myself
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      indebted to ye greatly.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I will enter to your credit all the talent ye may claim;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For the sake, my Best and Bellingham, of Little What 's-her-
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I have yielded, I confess it, quite a dozen times before
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To the fatal fascinations of the darlings of the Drama.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I have idolised my Wilton, I have loved my Nelly Moore;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And I see a host of others in a sort of panorama,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Reaching downwards to Miss Thingamy&mdash;an evanescent flame,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whom I sacrificed a month ago for Little What 's-her-name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The man who takes the money for my shillingsworth of pit
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Has an aggravating habit of alluding to the weather;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I never fail to notice, from the corner where I sit,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      That the feminine attendants take to whispering together.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The fiddlers in the orchestra do very much the same;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For they know that I m the worshipper of Little What's-her-
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I met her, quite promiscuous, a week or two ago;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To see her was to recognise&mdash;young Love's a pretty tutor&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      She was affably conversing with a man I didn't know;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But I fancied, in my jealousy, I was probably her suitor.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It might have been a relative; but was it not a shame
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      That I couldn't breathe my sentiments to Little What's-her-
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      name?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I should like to make a tender of my heart and of my hand,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      (For it strikes me that at present I have nothing else to proffer;)
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But since I 've neither intellect nor money at command,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      She would probably insult me by declining such an offer.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It's not so much the intellect&mdash;if Fortune, fickle dame,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Would grant me only opulence and Little What 's-her-name.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Will she read this emanation of a long-endured despair
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      With a particle of pity or an atom of emotion?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Will she linger for a moment o'er the verses that declare
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      All the fondness and the fulness of a Nobody's devotion?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I should seek no other honour&mdash;I should ask no higher fame
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Than a corner in the memory of Little What 's-her-name.
